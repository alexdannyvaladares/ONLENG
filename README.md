# Weight minimisation of a speed reducer

### **Non-Linear Problem : **

A speed reducer is simply a gear train between the motor and the machinery that is used to reduce the speed with which power is transmitted. Speed reducers, also called gear reducers, are mechanical gadgets by and large utilised for two purposes. First, they take the torque created by the power source (the input) and multiply it. Second, speed reducers, much as the name implies, reduce the speed of the input so that the output is the correct speed. In other words, gear reducers
essential use is to duplicate the measure of torque produced by an information power source to expand the measure of usable work.
